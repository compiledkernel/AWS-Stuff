# As we've seen in the create_bucket, list_buckets, and put_object methods,
# Client API requires you to explicitly specify all the input parameters for
# each operation. Most methods in the client class map to a single underlying
# API call to the AWS service - Amazon S3 in our case.
#
# Now that you got the hang of the Client API, let's take a look at Resouce
# API, which provides resource objects that further abstract out the over-the-
# network API calls.
# Here, we'll instantiate and use 'bucket' or 'object' objects.

# Buckets cannot be deleted unless they're empty. Let's keep using the
# Resource API to delete everything. Here, we'll utilize the collection
# 'objects' and its batch action 'delete'. Batch actions return a list
# of responses, because boto3 may have to take multiple actions iteratively to
# complete the action.
